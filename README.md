# Cyberpunk Air Quality Project Brief

## Project Overview
We're developing a web application that displays real-time air quality and weather data for Bombay Beach, CA, with a cyberpunk aesthetic. The app fetches data from multiple APIs and presents it in a visually engaging format.

## Current State
- Backend: Python Flask app (app.py)
- Frontend: HTML/JavaScript single-page application (index.html)
- Data Sources: National Weather Service (NWS), Open-Meteo, and World Air Quality Index (WAQI)

## Key Components
1. Backend (app.py):
   - Flask server with CORS enabled
   - Asynchronous data fetching from three APIs
   - RESTful endpoint (/api/airquality) returning combined data
   - Error handling and logging

2. Frontend (index.html):
   - Cyberpunk-styled UI
   - JavaScript for data fetching and display
   - Auto-refresh every 5 minutes

3. Environment:
   - .env file for storing the WAQI API key

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- aiohttp for asynchronous HTTP requests
- HTML5/CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Current Functionality
- Fetches and displays AQI data from WAQI
- Retrieves weather data from NWS and Open-Meteo
- Presents data in a cyberpunk-themed UI

## Potential Next Steps
1. Implement error handling for API timeouts or failures
2. Add data caching to reduce API calls
3. Enhance the UI with more cyberpunk elements or animations
4. Integrate additional data sources for more comprehensive information
5. Implement user location detection for personalized data
6. Add historical data tracking and visualization

## Known Issues
- None currently reported, but thorough testing is needed

## Questions for Continuation
1. What specific enhancements or features should we prioritize next?
2. Are there any performance optimizations we should consider?
3. How can we make the UI more engaging or interactive?
4. Should we consider adding any new data sources or parameters?
5. Are there any specific cyberpunk elements or themes we want to incorporate?
